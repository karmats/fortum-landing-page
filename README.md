# Design challenge

TRINE is doing a collaboration with the electricity company Fortum. It’s a new stand-alone product that needs a landing page. 

Requirements:
* Implement the design sketch by using CSS/Sass & HTML
* The design should be responsive (of course). You have design sketches for mobile and desktop, but don’t forget about the screen sizes in between.
* The sketch for mobile is missing some components, but I’m sure you’ll find a good solution!
* Use the images and fonts provided (Lato is also available on Google Fonts) 
* Present your solution in GitHub or CodePen

Remember, this is a design challenge. If you write pretty code it’s a bonus, but for this test we’ll focus more on the visual outcome.
